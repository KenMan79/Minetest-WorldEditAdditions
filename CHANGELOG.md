# WorldEditAdditions Changelog
It's about time I started a changelog! This will serve from now on as the master changelog for WorldEditAdditions.


## v1.8 (unreleased)
 - Update `//multi` to display human readable times (e.g. `2.11mins` instead of `126600ms`)
 - Far wand: Notify player when setting pos1 and pos2
 - Make timings more accurate (use `minetest.get_us_time()` instead of `os.clock()`)
 - Add `//subdivide`
